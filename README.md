# rtl_433_exporter

This is a Prometheus exporter that uses the hardware from https://www.geekdave.io/posts/temperature-sensors-grafana/
and a [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/timsimmons/rtl_433) for the brilliant [rtl_433](https://github.com/merbanan/rtl_433)

to turn temperature sensor data into Prometheus metrics in my house.

## TODO

- Some documentation
- A debug web handler
- Command line help
